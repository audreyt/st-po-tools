Here are various scripts facilitating Socialtext's .po-based I18N workflow.

The plan is to refactor them into something fit for general-purpose use,
then upload it to CPAN as a st-po-tools distribution.

Please consider this a work in progress and not ready for production use
at the moment.

Also see LICENSE for the terms (CPAL) for redistribution.
